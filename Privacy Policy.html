Privacy Policy

May 9, 2011

The CreditRiskMonitor Privacy Policy describes how we treat information when you use CreditRiskMontor's (CRMZ's) services, including information provided when you use the CRMZ Toolbar (Toolbar). In addition, the following describes our privacy practices that are specific to the Toolbar. We may change these practices from time to time, when we do we will post the changes on this page so that you can always be aware of the information that we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we may disclose it.

Information We Collect

You do not need to provide any personal identifying information in order to download and use the Toolbar. Except for Toolbar features that are specifically designed to work with a CRMZ Named User ID and Password, all of the features can be used without sharing any information. However, it is possible for URL data that usually contains no personally identifying information to contain such information in certain cases.

The Toolbar has some basic features that work automatically any time you use the Toolbar. Other features are optional, and only operate and transmit data if you choose to enable them.

Basic Toolbar Features

Any time you use the Toolbar, such as by entering a new URL in your browser or clicking on a hyperlink that takes you to a different web page, the Toolbar sends standard, limited information to a CRMZ server including
The URL (e.g., httpwww.ibm.com) of the web page you are viewing through the browser
Your machine's IP address
The version of your browser (e.g., IE 7.0)
The version of your operating system (e.g., Windows NT 5.1)
The version of the Toolbar (e.g., 1.2)
The date and time the Toolbar was first installed
The date and time the current version of the Toolbar was installed
This data may be retained in CRMZ's server logs and, if so, it is protected according to our general Privacy Policy. We use this information to improve the CRMZ service.
If you navigate to a URL that our server recognizes as being associated with a business in the CRMZ data base, the server returns CRMZ information about that business to the Toolbar, so you can quickly see a summary of the kinds of information available about the business.
Optional Toolbar Features

If you are a named user of CRMZ, with a User ID and Password, you may elect to enable additional Toolbar features, by logging in to the Toolbar, using the same credentials that you use to access the crmz.com website.
If you do log in to the Toolbar, your UserName and Password are stored on your computer in the Windows Registry, in encrypted form. Your encrypted UserName and Password are also included in the standard information sent by the Toolbar to CRMZ's servers, where the UserName (but not the Password) is retained in CRMZ's server logs.
If you opt to log into the Toolbar, when you navigate to a URL that matches a business in the CRMZ data base, additional information (available only to CRMZ named users) is returned by the CRMZ servers to the Toolbar and displayed. This additional information may include data items such as the business's FRISK® score, Z'' score, S&P rating, and Moody's rating, to provide you with a quick assessment of the financial strength of the business.
Information Security

The Toolbar will never request or accept any personal financial data (e.g., credit card data). However, it will not interfere with your browser or with any other software you may be running that does so.
Any information sent to CRMZ will be maintained in accordance with the CreditRiskMonitor Privacy Policy. CRMZ respects and protects the privacy of the individuals that use CRMZ's services, andor the CRMZ Toolbar. Individually identifiable information about you is not willfully disclosed or shared with any third party. CRMZ's Privacy Policy does not cover information that you send to third party sites.

Further information about the Toolbar andor your User ID is available from CRMZ at info@crmz.com, or call (845) 230-3000 and ask to speak with Client Services.
